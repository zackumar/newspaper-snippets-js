A bot that posts snippets of newspapers from 100 years ago! Check it out on Instagram at [@newspaper_snippets](https://instagram.com/newspaper_snippets) and on Twitter at [@news_snippets](https://twitter.com/news_snippets)!

## A Little Overview

So, recently, I built a bot that posts snippets of newspapers from exactly 100 years ago. Hence the name: newspaper_snippets! Here's what its tasks are:

-   Downloads a newspaper from Chronicling America

-   Finds a good focal point (though not all of them are the greatest)

-   Crops the image with a size of 1080 by 1080 (Max 1:1 size for Instagram)

-   Posts it on Instagram at [@newspaper_snippets](https://instagram.com/newspaper_snippets) and on Twitter at [@news_snippets](https://twitter.com/news_snippets)

## The Why?

I always wanted to create some form of art bot, but could never think of anything that would be interesting and different. This isn't that different either, but it was fun. It was created in a day, so the code is messy and needs fixing. Over time, I plan to tweak it and add more features, and especially clean up everything.

## What I Want to Add

-   ~~Better focal point detections (Such as prioritizing better images)~~ (Somewhat better. Better box detection)

-   Gain more followers. But that's not too important.

## What I'm currently working on

-   Disclaimer for indecent and offensive language as well as offensive images. (Images are harder to detect, but language can use Perspective and OCR)

## Also!

Check out [Chronicling America from the Library of Congress](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) where all of these images are from. It's pretty cool. They have a ton of newspapers from the U.S. I'm using the ones from 1777 to 1963 and there are a lot of editions. It's real neat.
